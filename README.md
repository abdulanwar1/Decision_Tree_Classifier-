# Decision_Tree_Classifier-
This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch to classify different types of wine based on a given dataset. The dataset, which includes features like alcohol content, color intensity, and flavonoids, is used to train a custom-built decision tree model. The model supports a basic implementation of the Decision Tree algorithm, with features such as Gini index and information gain to determine the best splits for the classification task. The model allows control over tree depth and the minimum samples required for splitting nodes, providing flexibility in handling complex datasets.

The project includes reading and preprocessing the dataset using pandas, splitting it into training and testing sets, and building the decision tree using NumPy. The decision tree classifier is then evaluated on the test data using accuracy as a metric. Additionally, the implementation features functions for calculating entropy, Gini index, and recursively splitting data based on thresholds. The output is a printed tree structure and a prediction accuracy score to assess the model's performance.
